A polynomial describing a quadric is valid if it can be represented
as a vector of its coefficients:

   In homogeneous form:
   [x^2 xy xz xw y^2 yz yw z^2 zw w^2]

   In classical form:
   [x^2 xy xz x y^2 yz y z^2 z 1]

To parse such a polynomial for any of the above formats, we need
to identify each monomial and associate it to an indice inside
the vector.

Let's consider a code of the form "XYZW", where each digit takes
as a value the power of each variable. For instance:

   x*y	   is encoded  1100
   x^2	   is encoded  2000
   z*w	   is encoded  0011
   y	   is encoded  0100

Concretly, each "digit" is stored inside an array of char.


I. Homogeneisation

To simplify the calculus, we first homogenise the 4 special cases:

   1000	    into  1001	  "x" becomes "x*w"
   0100	    into  0101	  "y" becomes "y*w"
   0010	    into  0011	  "z" becomes "z*w"
   0000	    into  0002	  "c" becomes "c*w^2", where c is an integer 
							     constant.

Note that homogenising consists in adding the missing quantity to
obtain a sum of two.

II. Checking

A monomial is valid iff the word XYZW verifies: X+Y+Z+W=2
Any other case is invalid, and an error is reported just before 
hashing the monomial.


III. Hashing

The hashing is made of two steps. The first one consists in
calculating a key "K" from the encoded word XYZW. The second one
uses an association table that links each possible (unique) value of
"K" to its corresponding indice inside the vector.

The key is calculated as follow:

    K = W + 2*Z + 4*Y + 8*X


Here are the values of "K" calculated for each valid case of the
word XYZW:


   X Y Z W	Vector indice	K
----------------------------------
(VALID CASES ONLY)
0| 2 0 0 0		0	16
1| 0 2 0 0		4	 8
2| 0 0 2 0		7	 4
3| 0 0 0 2		9	 2
4| 1 0 0 1		3	 9
5| 1 1 0 0		1	12 
6| 1 0 1 0		2	10
7| 0 1 0 1		6	 5
8| 0 1 1 0		5	 6
9| 0 0 1 1		8	 3


Deduced hash table: 
('-' means 'no image for the corresponding value of K'):
